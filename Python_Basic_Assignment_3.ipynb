    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "     1)It helps to divide the large programs into small groups so that we can read the code and debug then              program faster and better\n",
    "     2) Functions stop us from writing the same logic again and again. We can create the logic in one function          and call the function whenever we require.\n",
    "     3)Many persons can work on the same program by assigning different methods to the function.\n",
    "     4)In short, Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and        easier to update.\n",

The statements after the return statements are not       executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.
